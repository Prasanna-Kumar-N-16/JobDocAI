# JobDocAI
JobDocAI is a tool that generates tailored resumes and cover letters based on job descriptions and user experience. Built with a Python backend and a React frontend, it leverages OpenAI to craft polished career documents. Users input their details, and the app generates a single Word document combining both resume and cover letter.
